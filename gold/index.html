            <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems.Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.</p>

            <h3>What is "Open Source" software?</h3>
            <p class="answer">     Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.

    The internationally recognized Open Source Definition provides ten criteria that must be met for any software license, and the software distributed under that license, to be labeled "Open Source software." Only software licensed under an OSI-approved Open Source license should be labeled "Open Source" software.

            <h3>How can I help improve the OSI web site?</h3>
            <p class="answer"> The OSI web site uses the Drupal content management system (Drupal is, of course, open source software). The web page content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license, which offers similar freedoms for non-software works as open source offers for software works.</p>

            <h3>Is there a concept of copyright/trademark in open source?</h3>
            <p class="answer"> Yes, almost all open source code is copyrighted. The copyright holder is the one who typically specifies the license attached to the open source code that governs the obligations of the user of the open source.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>what is the need for successful open source project</h3>
            <p class="answer">    A real, tangible, significant, pressing market problem exists.
    Talented developers are highly motivated to work on solving that problem. In other words, people care.
    Vendors see enough profit potential to devote resources to the effort.
